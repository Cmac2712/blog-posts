I have been a web developer for the best part of a decade. In that time I have developed the odd insight into the practice. As I close in on a decade of this practice I think: "Why not unleash some of these insights unto the world?".

Expect to see posts here about React, TypeScript, the ever-evolving world of front-end javascript devlopemnt and maybe the odd opinion here and there.

If that's the type of thing you like to read about then please take a look around. If not: please send me an abusive message on twitter
